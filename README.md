# Rubik's Cube Timer

By Peter Li and Akshar Sarvesh

## Overview

A Rubik's Cube timing app. Stores statistics in a database and pulls from there. 
Note: ao5 and ao12 are not straight up averages - they look at the 5 or 12 times to aggregate over, removes the best and worst times, and then averages the middle 3 or 10. This is done for each row independently.
